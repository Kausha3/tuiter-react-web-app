    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
        classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
        Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
        Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
        word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
        sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
        Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
        popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
        amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
        interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are
        also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
        translation by H. Rackham.</p>

    <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have
        suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look
        even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be
        sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
        generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the
        first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined
        with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
        The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
        non-characteristic words etc.</p>
